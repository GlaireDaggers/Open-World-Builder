# Open World Builder
Open source level editor toolkit built on FNA+ImGui.NET

## Goal
An open-source generic 3D level editor designed to be integrated into any game or engine.
Inspired by the way LDTK, Ogmo, and Tiled serve as generic 2D tile based editors, and also taking inspiration from Unity Editor, Godot, and Trenchbroom.
